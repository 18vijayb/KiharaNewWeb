- title: MASQ PPI
  description: The purpose of MAss spectrometry data and Protein SeQuence-based PPI prediction method (MASQ_PPI) is to develop a complementary computational approach to aid large-scale protein-protein interactions (PPIs) identification using mass spectrometry data. 
               The protein elution profiles are generated from size-exclusive chromatography followed by mass spectrometry. 
               Proteins are clustered based on their elution profile. 
               Then sequence-based computational prediction method are performed on the protein pairs from the same cluster by support vector machine to exclude some false positive interactions. Visit the code on Github.

- title: EMD 1.0 (Ensemble Motif Discovery)
  description: EMD (Ensemble Motif Discovery) is an ensemble (consensus) algorithm that identifies one or more frequent motifs among multiple sequences. 
               The basic idea is to combine motif predictions from multiple runs of multiple component algorithms to build consensus motifs as its prediction. 
               In the current version, five component algorithms are included - AlignACE, BioProspector, MotifSampler, MDScan, and MEME. 
               The former three are stochastic algorithms, while the latter two are deterministic algorithms.Visit the server
